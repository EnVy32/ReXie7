# 🏎️ ReXie7 | JDM Price Forecaster AI

> **"Architect Your Dream Car Analysis."**

**ReXie7** is an advanced, AI-powered market analysis tool designed to forecast the prices of Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) vehicles. Built for data scientists and automotive enthusiasts, it leverages **Asynchronous Web Scraping** and **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** to provide real-time valuation with surgical precision.

## 🔮 What is ReXie7?

Most price predictors use static, outdated datasets. **ReXie7** is alive. 

It connects directly to live Japanese export markets (e.g., TC-V), ingests thousands of listings in seconds using a custom AsyncIO engine, and trains a bespoke AI model on the fly. It doesn't just tell you what a car *was* worth last year; it tells you what it's worth *right now*.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **⚡ Async Neural Scraper:** Fetches 100+ pages of market data concurrently using `aiohttp`.
* **🧠 Auto-Tuned XGBoost Core:** Uses Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters specifically for the current dataset.
* **💎 Smart Grade Decoding:** Automatically categorizes messy JDM trim levels (e.g., "13G L Pkg" → "Base", "RS" → "Sport").
* **📉 Statistical Sanitization:** Uses Interquartile Range (IQR) logic to remove damaged/junk listings automatically.
* **🔮 The Oracle:** A dedicated interface to input specific specs (Year, Mileage, Grade) and receive an instant valuation.
